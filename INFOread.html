## EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE IS ##
## IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT LANGUAGE TO WE USE TO WRITE THE CODE ##

## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

- HTML is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web. In your examples, HTML is used to define the structure of the webpage, including elements like div, img, and video tags. HTML is responsible for organizing content in a meaningful way, such as placing a video or GIF within a container.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- CSS is used to style HTML content and control the layout and appearance of elements. In your examples, CSS is used to:

- (a) Set the background color of the body.
- (b) Style the container and the video/GIF elements to ensure they cover the entire viewport.
- (c) Apply animations using @keyframes and other properties to create visual effects.

## Other Technologies

- While HTML and CSS form the core of web development, additional technologies can further enhance web pages:

## JavaScript

- JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It can be used for:

- (a) Complex animations and effects.
- (b) Dynamic content updates based on user actions.
- (c) Event handling, such as clicks or form submissions.
- (d) Fetching data from servers using APIs.

Although your examples do not include JavaScript, it is commonly used alongside HTML and CSS to create interactive and dynamic web pages.

## Web APIs

- Web APIs are interfaces provided by browsers that allow developers to interact with the browser and underlying system features using JavaScript. Examples include:

- (a) DOM API (Document Object Model): Allows JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS dynamically.
- (b) Canvas API: Used for drawing graphics and animations.
- (c) Fetch API: Provides a way to make network requests to fetch resources like data or images.

## SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

- SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML. It allows for the creation of scalable images and animations that remain sharp and clear at any size. SVG is ideal for vector-based graphics, such as icons, logos, and illustrations.

## WebAssembly

- WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format that enables high-performance applications on web pages. It allows code written in languages like C, C++, and Rust to run in the browser with near-native performance. While more advanced and not directly related to your current examples, WebAssembly is useful for performance-intensive applications.

## Summary of Technologies in Your Examples

- Here's a summary of the technologies used in your HTML examples and their purposes:

✅ HTML: Structures web content and defines the placement of elements like videos and GIFs.
✅ CSS: Styles HTML content, controls layout, and applies animations for visual effects.
❌ JavaScript (not used in your examples but commonly used): Adds interactivity, dynamic behavior, and event handling.
❌ Web APIs (not used in your examples but commonly used with JavaScript): Interact with browser features and fetch resources.
❌ SVG (not used in your examples but useful for scalable graphics): Defines vector-based graphics and animations.
❌ WebAssembly (not used in your examples but useful for performance): Enables high-performance applications in the browser.
